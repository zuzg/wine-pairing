# wine-pairing üç∑
Project in the realm of semantic webs dedicated to constructing a knowledge graph focused on wines. The foundation of the graph is rooted in the FlavorGraph, as detailed in the publication [FlavorGraph](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-79422-8).

## Implementation
The steps performed to achieve goal can be found in the corresponding notebooks.
1. Wine data preprocessing
2. Food data preprocessing
3. Wine-pairing
4. Data preparation for FlavorGraph
5. Results analysis

The FlavorGraph was trained using the original implementation with minor adjustments, available in the [fork](https://github.com/azywot/FlavorGraph).

## Datasets
To pair wine and food, the following datasets were used:
* [Wine reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/roaldschuring/wine-reviews)
* [Food reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews)
